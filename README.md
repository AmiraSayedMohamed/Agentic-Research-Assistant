## ðŸš€ Project Overview

**Agentic Research Assistant** is a state-of-the-art multi-agent AI system designed to streamline academic research for the **Multi-Agent Hackathon**. It automates the time-consuming tasks of searching, summarizing, synthesizing, and presenting academic papers, delivering a cohesive report with audio narration, optional NFT monetization, and a stunning interactive dashboard.

Built with **Coral Protocol** for secure agent orchestration, **Nebius AI Studio** for scalable LLM inference, **ElevenLabs** for voice synthesis, and **Crossmint** for payments/NFTs, this project is a production-ready, modular solution optimized for hackathon demos and real-world scalability.

**Problem Solved**: Researchers spend hours manually searching and synthesizing papers. We automate this process with intelligent agents, producing human-like reports, plagiarism checks, and enhanced PDF analysis.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Multi-Agent System**:
  - **Search & Retrieval Agent**: Queries academic APIs (arXiv, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, GitHub) concurrently. Outputs standardized JSON: `{title, authors, abstract, publication_date, doi/url, full_text_url}`.
  - **Summary Agent**: Generates 200-300 word summaries for up to 10 papers using LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 or Llama 3 via Nebius). Includes relevance scores (0-100%).
  - **Synthesizer Agent**: Produces 800-1500 word reports with themes, conflicts, gaps, and recommendations. Uses IEEE-style citations [1].
  - **Voice Presentation Agent**: Converts reports to natural audio via ElevenLabs (voice: "Adam", speed: 1.0). Outputs MP3 with section timestamps.
  - **Monetization Agent**: Supports payments ($0.99/query via Crossmint/Stripe) or NFT minting (Solana, with metadata: topic, timestamp, hash). Tracks usage in SQLite.

- **PDF Analysis**:
  - Upload PDFs for parsing with PyMuPDF (sentences, bounding boxes).
  - Citation mapping via regex; RAG pipeline with FAISS and sentence-transformers.
  - LLM-driven gap detection (e.g., "Methodological gap: [2] lacks validation").

- **Humanize & Plagiarism Check**:
  - Humanizes text with LLM for natural tone; scores via perplexity (lower = more human).
  - Plagiarism detection via cosine similarity (>0.85 threshold).
  - On-demand rephrasing with 3 variants and human-scores.

- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - Built with **React 18 + Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui** for a professional, responsive UI.
  - Real-time progress via WebSockets.
  - Tabs: Summaries (accordion cards), Report (Markdown with clickable citations), Gaps (sortable table), PDF Viewer (highlight citations), Audio (waveform player), Plagiarism (risk gauge).
  - Visuals: Word cloud, relevance pie chart, human/plagiarism score bars.
  - Features: Drag-and-drop PDF upload, export to PDF/CSV, dark mode, animations.

- **Orchestration & Security**:
  - **Coral Protocol** for zero-trust agent calls.
  - **FastAPI** backend with Celery for async tasks, Redis queue, Postgres for jobs.
  - Rate limiting, input sanitization, GDPR-compliant data handling.

- **Scalability**: Async API calls, Nebius for AI scaling, modular agents for Coral Registry reuse.
